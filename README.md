## Welcome to Silent Moon

### About this fork

I initially contributed to this project as a member of a collaborative team.
Once the project was completed and presented I decided to go at it again to fully grasp each individual work, approach and solution.

I introduced changes that focused on enhancing component reusability and decided to give it a slightly new look.

I tried to focus on the reusability factor across different sections of the app by refactoring and reorganizing components.
Since I was initially working on the backend part of the project I enjoyed changing perspective and going through the frontend - finding different work arounds and more simplified code snippets.
